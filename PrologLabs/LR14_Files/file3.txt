It’s windy, windy, windy today
Let’s fly a kite. Hip, hip, hurray!!
But the weather is changing
The weather is changing
Look at the sky, wow amazing
It’s sunny, sunny, sunny today
Let’s go outside to play
But the weather is changing
The weather is changing
Look at the sky, wow amazing
It’s raining, raining, raining today
Inside is where I want to stay
But the weather is changing
The weather is changing
Look at the sky, wow amazing
It’s snowing, snowing, snowing today
Let’s ski down a mountain all the way!
But the weather is changing
The weather is changing
Look at the sky, wow amazing
It’s cloudy, cloudy, cloudy today
Will it rain, I just can’t say.
